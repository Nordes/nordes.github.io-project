        I started my career long ago when I was still a kid. Computer related stuff was one of the thing I always loved to do and that's where I went when I choose to become an IT Engineer.

        After studies I worked a few years in Canada before moving to France in order to explore new opportunities. I had great time and had the opportunity to work as a Consultant for about 5 years. Meanwhile I met someone in my life and decided to move into the Netherlands where I've worked in the chatbot/ai industry for about 2 years. Finally, recently i moved in Japan, my wife country, where I still pursue my career as an IT Specialist in the Hyogo prefecture.

        During these years I had the opportunity to work with many different technologies such as C#, JavaScript (NodeJs), SQL Server, Redis, Oracle, Java, Php, and so on. Technology is only a mean to an end and that's why we should never stop looking around what's happening. It then help to choose the best technologies for any projects. I worked as a developer (Full stack), architect, DBA and also done customer facing in order to get the specification. However, what I love the most is to play with all the new technologies (who doesn't).
